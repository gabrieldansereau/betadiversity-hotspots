## Abstract

Beta diversity is an essential measure to describe the organization of
biodiversity in space. 
The calculation of local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD), specifically, 
allows for the identification of sites with exceptional diversity within a
region of interest, which is useful for both community ecology and conservation 
purposes. 
However, beta diversity implies a comparison among the sites of a given region, 
thus, its use is restricted to sites with known species composition, and to 
discontinuous spatial scales. 
We therefore propose a method to calculate LCBD indices on continuous scales for
a whole region of interest, including unsampled sites. 
First, species distributions can be predicted on continuous scales using species
distribution models (SDM). 
These models, such as the BIOCLIM method, use the environmental conditions at 
sampled sites to predict the presence or absence of each species at unsampled 
locations.
Second, LCBD statistics can then be computed on the SDM predictions. 
We show that it is therefore possible to identify beta diversity hotspots on 
spatially continuous and extended scales. 
Our results confirm that LCBD values are related to species richness, and that
species-poor sites contribute most to beta diversity.
